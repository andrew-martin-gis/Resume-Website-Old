            <p>This Python Script is used to automate the grid creation process in JOSM.</p>

            <p>This script takes 2 coordinates, a top left and a bottom right, to create an array of grids with the offset calculation. It is dependent on user input for a few other factors such as the number of grids you would like to make and the naming scheme. It then creates an .osm file for each grid with a bounding box drawn and a single node inside as a placeholder to open in JOSM.</p>
